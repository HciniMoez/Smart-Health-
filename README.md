# Machine Learning Project on Disease Predictions using Symptoms
# Problem Statement 
Health information needs are also changing the information seeking behavior and can be 
observed around the globe. Challenges faced by many people are looking online for health 
information regarding diseases, diagnoses and different treatments. If a recommendation system 
can be made for doctors and medicine while using review mining will save a lot of time. In this 
type of system, the user face problem in understanding the heterogeneous medical vocabulary as 
the users are laymen. User is confused because a large amount of medical information on 
different mediums are available.The idea behind recommender system is to adapt to cope with the special requirements of the health domain related with users.


# Explanation of Files
## training.csv
* This is the main dataset which has been used in this project. This dataset consist of mainly two columns "Disease" and "Symptoms" but this dataset is preprocessed so it helps in easily clasifying the data. This dataset is used to train our model.

## testing.csv
* This is the dataset which has been used to test our model so that we can know the accuracy of our model. this dataset is predefined with output.


## Project_ML.ipynb
This is the jupyter notebook which consist of complete code. This is used to explain the working of each and every module used in the project.
